This code is related to:

B. J. Culpepper and B. A. Olshausen, "Learning transport operators for
image manifolds", NIPS 2009.

and my thesis:

B. J. Culpepper. "Learned factorization models to Explain Variability in
Natural Image Sequences", UC Berkeley EECS Ph.D. 2011.

The code implements a MAP-EM algorithm to learn a basis for exponential
operators that can be used to "explain" image sequences in terms of pixel
transformations. Another way to think of it is as sparse coding for image
transformations.

The energy function is:

E = 0.5 * \sum_{lt} | x_l(t) - \expm( \sum_j \psi_{jlm} c_j ) x_m(t-1) |^2 +
    \lambda \sum_j | c_j |

For a given psi, the solution to

\arg \min_{c_j} E

fits an infinite order polynomial through two data points x(t) and x(t-1).
This polynomial is generated from the basis psi, so the problem is not
hopelessly under-constrained.

(I hope to expand on this README later!)

The code depends on lbfgsb-stewart (also available in my github repo), and
the availability of some movie data.
